**WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Powered** is a complete foundation for building your WordPress plugins following PSR-4 standard.  
The project history is part of the [Wiki](https://wpbp.github.io/wiki.html) that also includes the workflow and how it is organized.

Every experienced WordPress developer uses always the same libraries (or snippets) but at the same time follows best practices.  
Choose a library or a snippet and the boilerplate (with the help of the [Code Generator](https://wpbp.github.io/#generator))
will generate everything without the need of manual copy&paste way or searching on the Internet!

## Features
